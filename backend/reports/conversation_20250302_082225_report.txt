Here's a structured medical report based on the provided doctor-patient conversation:

-   **Title**: Consultation for Sore Throat and Mild Cough

-   **Description**: The patient presented with a chief complaint of feeling "period" for the past two days, accompanied by a sore throat. The patient also reported a mild cough, but denied any difficulty breathing.

-   **Medical Conditions**:
    *   Possible viral upper respiratory infection (due to sore throat and cough).
    * "period" feeling requires clarification if the patient means that he/she feels unwell, or if its related to menstruation.

-   **Suggestions and Medications**:
    *   Need more information about the sympthoms.

-   **Results**:
    *   No tests were performed during this conversation. No physical examination findings are available.

-   **Overall Summary**: The patient reports a two-day history of feeling "period", a sore throat, and a mild cough without dyspnea. The limited information suggests a possible upper respiratory infection, most likely viral, but further questioning is required to clarify the meaning of the term "period" in this context and to rule out other potential, although less likely, causes. A follow-up, potentially with a physical examination, would be beneficial to establish a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.
