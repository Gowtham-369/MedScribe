Here's a structured medical report based on the provided doctor-patient conversation:

- **Title**: Consultation for Flu-like Symptoms

- **Description**: The patient presented with complaints of feeling unwell for the past few days, accompanied by a sore throat. They reported a mild cough, no difficulty breathing, body aches, and fatigue. The patient denied recent travel or contact with sick individuals.

- **Medical Conditions**: Viral Infection

- **Suggestions and Medications**:
    *   Paracetamol for fever.
    *   Lozenges for sore throat.
    *   Drink warm fluids.
    *   Rest.

- **Results**:
    *   Mild fever (104 degrees - *Note: there's a typo in the original text saying "14", which is impossible for a body temperature. I am assuming it is 104, which makes a case for fever.*)
    *   Redness in the throat.

- **Overall Summary**: The doctor assessed the patient's symptoms and physical findings (mild fever, throat redness) and concluded that the patient likely has a viral infection. Symptomatic treatment with paracetamol and lozenges was recommended, along with advice on hydration and rest.
